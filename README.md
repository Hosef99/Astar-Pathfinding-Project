# A* Pathfinding Visualization

A* Pathfinding Visualization is a web-based project that offers an interactive platform for visualizing the A* pathfinding algorithm. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the p5.js framework to provide users with a hands-on experience of observing how the A* algorithm finds the shortest path between a start and an end point while avoiding obstacles.


## Getting Started

To begin using the A* Pathfinding Visualization, access the application by visiting [A* Pathfinding Visualization](https://hosef99.github.io/Astar-Pathfinding-Project/) in your preferred web browser. Then, follow these steps, each involving buttons:


1. Utilize the "Change Start Position" button to modify the starting position. Click on a cell after pressing the button to assign it as the new starting position.

2. Similarly, the "Change End Position" button allows you to alter the endpoint. Click on a cell after clicking the button to set it as the new endpoint.

3. For drawing obstacles, activate the "Draw Obstacles" button. Then, clicking on cells will designate them as impassable obstacles.

4. If you intend to erase all obstacles simultaneously, the "Delete All Obstacles" button will serve that purpose.

5. To remove individual obstacles, select the "Erase Obstacles" button and click on the specific obstacles to clear them.

6. Commence the algorithm with the "Start" button, initiating the A* algorithm's execution.

7. Pausing the algorithm in its tracks is achievable using the "Pause" button.

8. To resume the algorithm from a paused state, simply hit the "Resume" button.

9. When you wish to reset the visualization entirely, choose the "Clear All Nodes" button.

10. Finally, for manually progressing through the algorithm's execution, use the "Open Next Node" button to highlight each explored node sequentially.

Through these button-based interactions, you can effectively navigate and observe the A* pathfinding algorithm in action.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styles the visual components, making the interface user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the A* algorithm and manages user interactions.
- **p5.js**: A creative coding library utilized for rendering, allowing visual representation of the algorithm's execution.
